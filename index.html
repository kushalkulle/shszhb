                <p class="mt-4 text-white">Sanghamitra High School was established in the year 1994 by late Sri S.Jaipal Reddy
                    (founder). It was
                    a humble beginning with just 114 students and 7 teachers in a rented building. I feel very proud
                    that we have our own spacious building in 2 Acre campus. Our family tree has grown to over 1000
                    children and 70 teaching and non-teaching staff. Parents and community are an integral part of the
                    educational institution system. The school management, parents, community and even students are all
                    stake holders. The involvement of each and every segment of the system is important for the success
                    of the educational institution.</p>
