                    It is universally believed that the foremost aim of education is all round development of the child.
                    The end of education is man making. Education is that which forms the character, increases the
                    strength of mind, expands the Intellect and enables one to stand on one's feet.


                    Established in 1994 Sanghamitra High School owes its origin to Sanghamitra Educational Society (An
                    educational Society registered with Registrar of Societies) Hyderabad vide Registration No.2392/95
                    has been incorporated with the main object of establishing institutions to impart education and
                    training, especially to lift self-confidence, creative thinking and entrepreneurship.



                    The philosophy is simple, quality education should be made affordable for every section of society.
                    Quality education does not just mean academics, but the entire gamut of extra-curricular and
                    co-curricular activities. There are absolutely no hidden costs, nor funds collected to maintain
                    equality among all our students. We do not organize expensive excursions and trips, nor run a
                    canteen and stationery in our school premises or encourage students to celebrate their birthdays
                    lavishly in the school. For us each and every Sanghamitra student is special, irrespective of
                    economic background, caste, creed, sex and religion.

                <p>
                    In fulfilling the vision and mission of the school, parents have a great role to play. They have to
                    re-inforce those values. It is said that, to educate a child, parents should educate themselves. It
                    is only through example, role model, principles and values can be transmitted effectively. The
                    learning process of a child starts from mata, pita and then guru comes into the picture.


                    I would like to request parents to spend at least an hour with their children and help in the
                    renewal of different facts, physical, intellectual and emotional needs of the children. Parents
                    should spend at least 15 to 30 minutes of exercising with their children either by walking or
                    aerobics or any other physical activity, which helps them to keep fit.


                    Parents should not look at the marks in the progress report but assess the child’s development
                    through behavioral changes. Give your children catalystic and supportive facilitation rather than
                    discourage and demotivate them when they get less marks than your expectation. Children are put to
                    enormous stress and strain in today’s competitive world. As a parent try to help your children by
                    giving them moral support and boost up their courage.
